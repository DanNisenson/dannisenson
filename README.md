## Hi there! 👋👀

### My name is [Dan Nisenson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-nisenson/)(`He/Him`) and I make projects become real through code
![CodeWars kyu](https://www.codewars.com/users/ChinoMoriarty/badges/micro)

I'm currently developing web portfolio pages as a freelancer and taking Harvard's Computer Science 50 online course.
I **love** learning about science, human behaviour, the brain and how it translates to our everyday life through technology. 

Coming from a music production background I find coding such a blast. Both are at the intersection of tech, team dynamics and creativity. 

Some of my biggest influences through the years have been:

- 🐒 Robert Sapolsky's Stanford [lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNnIGh9g6fA&list=PL150326949691B199) on Human Behavioral Biology.
- ✨ Rick Rubin's approach to creativity and maximizing outcomes for abstract processes.
- 💽 The impact of how recording technology (and signal processing in general) shaped the way we think and experience media.
- 📚 They're so many and so interconnected I should probably start a blog
